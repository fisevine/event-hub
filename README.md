# EventHub: Sita Evans' Individual Project

### Problem Statement
Living in a smaller town with lots of local, community-based businesses, I have found that there is a disconnect between getting event information to the general population.  My town relies on word of mouth and bulletin boards: if you are new to the town or in the more rural parts, this can feel limiting or even intimidating!  The closest thing to an online presence is the town's Facebook group, which is not exclusively event-oriented.  People feel left out of the community.

### Goal
Create a user-friendly website that allows event hosts (admins) to post events and relevant details that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection (guests) in a clear and pleasing way.
